# Retail Sales Dataset Analysis with LangChain and SQL

This project demonstrates how to use the LangChain framework to analyze a retail sales dataset and interact with a database using SQL. It also uses the `ChatGroq` large language model (LLM) to query the database and execute an agent-based task.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- LangChain
- Pandas
- SQLAlchemy
- Kaggle dataset access
- Groq API key for ChatGroq

## Installation

To set up the environment and install the required libraries, run:

```bash
%pip install -qU langchain langchain-openai langchain-community langchain-experimental pandas sqlalchemy langchain-groq
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Retail Sales Dataset** available on Kaggle. Make sure to download it and provide the correct path to the CSV file in the script.

```python
df = pd.read_csv("/kaggle/input/retail-sales-dataset/retail_sales_dataset.csv")
```

## Database Setup

We create a SQLite database named `customer.db` and upload the dataset into a table called `customer`.

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///customer.db")
df.to_sql("customer", engine, index=False)
```

## LangChain Integration

We use the LangChain `SQLDatabase` utility to interface with the SQLite database, allowing us to run SQL queries on the dataset.

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase
db = SQLDatabase(engine=engine)
print(db.run("SELECT * FROM customer WHERE Age > 10;"))
```

## ChatGroq Model

The project integrates the `ChatGroq` model, which requires a valid Groq API key. The key can be set in the environment:

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["GROQ_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

Once configured, we use the `ChatGroq` LLM to create an agent that can query the database.

```python
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
llm = ChatGroq(model="llama3-8b-8192")
```

## SQL Agent Tool

Using LangChain's SQL agent toolkit, we build an agent that can query the `customer.db` and provide natural language responses.

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import create_sql_agent
agent_executor = create_sql_agent(llm, db=db, agent_type="openai-tools", verbose=True)
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "are there any female customers?"})
```

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of LangChain with databases and LLMs to query and analyze datasets effectively. By following the setup instructions, you can adapt it for other datasets and models.
